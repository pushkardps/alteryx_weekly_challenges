This was def not a piece of cake.

new learning - data cleansing tool (only used impute tool till now), multi-row tool, dynamic rename tool
special mention - multi-row tool - absolutely mind blown over this one, dynamic rename is pretty handy as well

started off with doing field summary of the data. field summary tool is a really cool way to get idea
of data both qualitatively and quantitatively. It calculates all statistics for the variables - mean, max, mode, % data missing etc
and you also see histograms of all variables which again tells % data missing as well.

After I saw missing data ~9% in all numerical variables, I used Data cleansing tool to impute the NULLs to 0.
If I wanted to add any other value except 0, I would have had to use impute tool. Data Cleansing only allows to add 0 or blanks.
On a whole, I think Impute tool is stronger. 

Next I used cross-tab to make data easier to manipulate and used sort tool to properly group the data.
It was followed by using multi-row tool to get the needed running average. This was the first time 
I used this tool, till now I have only used Formula tool which did not give access to any particular row,
rather the logic was always implemented across the entire column. So formula tool is mostly for column manipulation.

Using Dynamic Rename next to rename the headers appropriately came in very handy, new to this tool as well.
I used it for adding a  Prefix to the column header but it has multiple uses like - adding header suffix, removing prefix/ suffix,
choosing first row of data as header and so on.
