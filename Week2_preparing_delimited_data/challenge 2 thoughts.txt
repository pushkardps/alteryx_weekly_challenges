Back to parsing with this one.

Special mention - RegEx_Replace function in the Formula tool.
Reminded how strong and powerful asset it is to know RegEx.

new learning - DateTime tool. Had never used this before.

Started off easy with splitting data into three columns,
then used formula tool RegEx replace funtion to remove un-needed 
charecters in the string. Thereupon I converted the columns,
all of them in string format to appropriate format using select tool.
After that, the only thing remaining was to convert the date column
to specified format using DateTime tool.
